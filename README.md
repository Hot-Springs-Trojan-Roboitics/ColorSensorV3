# ColorSensorV3

This Repository is built for use in the First Tech Challenge 2019-2020 SKYSTONE Season.

It utilizes the REV Color/Range Sensor V3 to detect color changes beneath the Robot to allow it to nagivagte during the Autonomous Period. The program included was designed using blocks, translated into OnBot Java and then placed into this repository for your use. Please make sure to credit us with the comments added and adapt for your own use. You can also just use the concepts freely to create your own programs for other uses this season. Thank you for reading and good luck!
